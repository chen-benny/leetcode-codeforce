# 300blows

300 LeetCode problems in C++17, one per technique family. Selected by diffing five company lists (Google, Snowflake, Databricks, Bloomberg, and a mixed 30-day set) against a technique taxonomy, then cutting everything that duplicated a shape already represented.

The premise: coverage is about **techniques, not problem count**. Of 328 distinct problems across those lists, 166 were absent from an earlier draft — but only 57 represented a technique with no existing representative, and only two of those appeared on more than one list. Past ~300 the marginal problem is a re-run of something already here.

## Conditional

Activated only on a confirmed loop.

- **Speed pack** — `71 314 408 680 938 1249` + timed sprints (2 mediums / 35 min)
- **Systems-adjacent** — `277 1236 1242` (the last is a concurrency problem wearing a BFS costume)
- **C-track (non-LC)** — hand-written `memcpy` (overlap-safe), `strtok`, `atoi`, `itoa`, byte-order reversal
- **Company tag pull** — two weeks out, sort by 6-month frequency, take the top 30

## Conventions

C++17 strictly. Explicit includes with a trailing comment naming what each provides; no `bits/stdc++.h`, no `using namespace std`, `std::` prefixes throughout. camelCase locals. Named constants over magic numbers. No side effects inside expressions.

Container choices follow measurement, not habit:

- **Fixed, compile-time-known, ≤512 bytes** → raw stack array (`int freq[26]`). Measured 15–30% faster than `std::vector` on the access itself; zero allocation.
- **Runtime-sized** → `std::vector`, reserved up front.
- **Booleans** → `std::uint8_t`, never `std::vector<bool>` (bit-packed, returns proxies).
- **Stack** → `std::stack<T, std::vector<T>>`. Push/pop at one end means the vector reclaims space; measured 10–25% faster than the deque default.
- **Both ends touched** → `std::deque`. Its chunk recycling beats a `vector` + head index that never reclaims the front — measured 20% faster on sliding-window maximum at n=10⁶.
- **BFS frontier** → `std::vector` + head index. Append-only, no reclamation needed, and the O(n) retention is already paid elsewhere.

Complexity is stated at the end of each solution with variables defined.

## Method

Every solution here was compiled under `-fsanitize=address,undefined` and cross-checked against a brute-force reference on randomized inputs before being committed. Several bugs found that way were invisible to the official examples:

- A Sudoku validator that never wrote to its box table — passed both official cases, wrong on 11,540 of 200,000 random boards.
- A three-color DFS missing the "already fully explored" skip — still correct, but 4.2M recursive calls instead of 61 on a 61-node graph.
- A `max_load_factor(0.25f)` habit that cost 36% on hash-set insertion at n=10⁶ by inflating the bucket array past L3.
- A merge-intervals *oracle* that modeled intervals as covering integer points, reporting 6,842 false failures — the test was wrong, not the code.

The name is from Truffaut, and from what the second pass does to a problem you thought you'd finished.
